        <p> Well that is a good question, I ask myself that question everyday. <br/><br/> 
            You want to know what I tell myself? <br/><br/>
            I tell myself that I am a WINNER!!! <br/><br/>
            Can you dig what Im sayin? <br/><br/>
            I bet you can, because if you're reading this, <br/>
            it's because you're a WINNER too.<br/><br/>
